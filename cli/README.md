# Fake CLI

Fake CLI is a fake command-line interface for command line self training.
Use it like:

```java
FakeLauncher.run("start");
```

## Ideas

- Fake CLI is a command-based launcher.
- Each command should have pre-command and post-command hook.
- Command might fail. A failed command should _never_ exit the JVM itself, exit the JVM is an
  application-level decision. It can only be decided by the launcher itself.
- It's crucial to have checkpoints. A failed persistent command must be able to be resumed, even if
  launcher has exited. Command data is saved as persistent data.
- The result of a command should not be represented as boolean. Using enum or object is better: it
  provides more information about the result.
- The result of a command is returned as `CommandStatus` (like HTTP status), it is composed by
  command exit code and command line message.
- Options are handled by library [Commons CLI][commons-cli].
- A complex command is a composition of multiple unitary commands.
- A unitary command can _not_ be composed by other commands.
- Options can be grouped. For example, server options or marketplace options.
- Package name is resolved before running effective commands.
- The command is always executed using package ID.
