= Exception and Assertions

There're different kinds of exceptions:

* _Exception class_—Refers to `Throwable` class and all its subclasses.
* _Error classes_—Refers to `Error` class and all its subclasses
* _Runtime exception classes_—Refers to runtime exception classes and error classes
* _Unchecked exception classes_—Refers to runtime exception classes and error classes
* _Checked exception classes_—Refers to all exception classes other than the unchecked
exception classes. Class `Throwable` and any of its subclasses that aren't a subclass
of either `Error` or `RuntimeException` are checked exceptions.

Here's the exception hierarchy:

* `java.lang.Throwable`
** `java.lang.Error`
** `java.lang.Exception`
*** `java.lang.RuntimeException`

== Exercise 6.1

Which answer correctly shows the output of class `TwistThrowsException`?

. `useReadFile`; `readFile`; `FileNotFoundException` thrown at runtime
. `useReadFile`; `FileNotFoundException` thrown at runtime
. Compilation error
. `FileNotFoundException` thrown at runtime
. `useReadFile`; `readFile`

.TwistThrowsException.java
[source,java]
----
import java.io.*;

class TwistThrowsException {

    public void readFile(String file) throws FileNotFoundException { // <2>
        System.out.println("readFile");
        throw new FileNotFoundException(); // <1>
    }

    void useReadFile(String name) throws FileNotFoundException { // <4>
        System.out.println("useReadFile");
        try {
            readFile(name);
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // <3>
            // code
        }
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        new TwistThrowsException).useReadFile("a"); // <5>
    }
}
----
<1> The exception `FileNotFoundException` is instantiated.
<2> It is thrown outside of the method `readFile(String)`.
<3> It is caught by method `useReadFile(String)`.
<4> Method `useReadFile(String)` declares also a `FileNotFoundException`, which is a checked exception.
<5> This method is used inside `main(String[])`, but it is never handled. `main(String[])` need to
  handle it using a try-catch block, or declare it in the method signature. *So the answer is C:
  "Compilation error"*.

== Exercise 6.3

Which answer correctly show the output of class `TestMultiCatch`?

.TestMultiCatch.java
[source,java]
----
import java.io.*;

class Exception1 extends IOException {}
class Exception2 extends Exception {}

class TestMultiCatch {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try {
            int a = 10;
            if (a <= 10) {
                throw new Exception1();
            } else {
                throw new Exception2();
            }
        } catch (Exception1 | Exception2 ex) {
            System.out.println(ex);
        }
    }
}
----

. Value similar to `Exception1@96a34`
. Value similar to `Exception2@45a86e`
. `Exception1`
. `Exception2`

The answer is C. An attempt to retrieve the value of a reference
variable itself calls its method `toString()`. The common base class
of classes `Exception1` and `Exception2` is `Exception`. Class
`Exception` inherits class `Throwable`, which overrides method
`toString()`. The default implementation of method `toString()` in
class `Throwable` returns the fully qualified name of the `Throwable`
instance (all `Exception` and `Error` classes) together with its
exception message.

== Exercise 6.4

Which answer correctly shows the output of class `AssertionTwist`?

[source,java]
----
public class AssertionTwist {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        evenOdd(-11);
    }
    static void evenOdd(int num) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Even");
        } else if (num % 2 == 1) {
            System.out.println("Odd");
        } else {
            System.out.println("This should never be printed");
            assert false : new Person();
        }
    }
}
class Person {
    private String toString() {
        return "Pirates of the Caribean";
    }
}
----

. `Odd`
. This should never be printed: `AssertionError: Pirates of the Caribbean`
. This should never be printed: `AssertionError: Person@6b97fd0dd`
. Compilation error
. A runtime exception

The answer is D. The code won't compile because while overriding `toString()`,
class `Person` assigns a weaker access level (`private`) to it. When you override a
base class method, you can assign the same or wider access level to it, but you
cannot make it more restrictive.

== Sample Exam Questions

=== Question 6.2

Given the following line of code

[source,java]
----
String s = "assert";
----

which of the following code options will compile successfully? (Choose all that apply).

. `assert(s == null : s = new String());`
. `assert s == null : s = new String();`
. `assert(s == null) : s = new String();`
. `assert(s.equals("assert"));`
. `assert s.equals("assert");`
. `assert s == "assert" ; s.replace('a', 'z');`
. `assert s = new String("Assert") : s.toString();`
. `assert s == new String("Assert") : System.out.println(s);`
. `assert(s = new String("Assert") : System.out.println(s));`

The answer is B C D E F. Option A is incorrect. For the longer form of the `assert`
statement that uses two expressions, you can't enclose both expressions within a single
parentheses. Option B is correct. It's optional to include the individual expressions
used in the longer form within a single parentheses. Options D and E are correct. The
shorter form of the `assert` statement uses only one expression, which might or might
not be included within parentheses. Option F is correct. The semicolon (;) placed after
the condition `s == "assert"` delimits the `assert` statement, and the statement
following the semicolon is treated as a separate statement. It's equivalent to an
`assert` statement using its shorter form followed by another statement, as follows:

[source,java]
----
assert s == "assert";
s.replace('a', 'z');
----

Option G is incorrect because the first expression in an `assert` statement must return
a `boolean` value. In this code, the first expression returns an object of class `String`.
Option H is incorrect because the second expression in an `assert` statement must return
a value of any type. In this code, the return type of method `println()` is `void`.
Option I is incorrect. it incorrectly encloses both expressions of the `assert` statement
with in a single pair of parentheses. If parentheses were removed, it's also an illegal
usage of the long form because it uses an expression that doesn't return a `boolean` value
for its first expression and its second expression doesn't return any value.

=== Question 6.5

Which of the following options show appropriate usage of assertions? (Choose all that apply.)

[source,java]
----
// INSERT CODE HERE
    assert (b != 0) : "Can't divide with zero";
    return (a / b);
}
----

. `public float divide(int a, int b) {`
. `public static float divide(int a, int b) {`
. `private static float divide(int a, int b) {`
. `private float divide(int a, int b) {`

The answer is CD. Options A and B are incorrect because assertions must not be used to
check method arguments for non-private methods. Non-private methods can be called by
objects of other classes, and you can't validate their method arguments by using
assertions. Assertions can be disabled at runtime, so they aren't the right option to
validate method arguments to public methods. You should throw exceptions in this case.
For example, when you come across invalid values that are passed to a non-private method,
you can throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

IMPORTANT: Assertions can be disabled at runtime, so they aren't the right option to
           validate method arguments to public methods.

=== Question 6.11

What's the output of the following code?

[source,java]
----
class Box implements AutoCloseable {
    public void open() throws Exception {
        throw new Exception();
    }
    public void close() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("close");
    }
}
class EJavaFactory {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Box box = new Box()) {
            box.open();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("catch: " + e);
        } finally {
            System.out.println("finally");
        }
    }
}
----

. `catch: java.lang.Exception`, `finally`
. `catch: java.lang.Exception`
. `close`, `finally`
. `close`, `catch: java.lang.Exception`, `finally`
. `close`, `catch: java.lang.Exception`, `catch: java.lang.Exception`, `finally`

The answer is D. The code `box.open()` within the `try` block throws an `Exception`.
Before the control is transferred to the exception handler, the resource `box` is
implicitly closed by calling its `close()` method, which also throws an `Exception`.

If an exception is thrown from the `try` block and one or more exceptions are thrown
from the try-with-resources statement, then those exceptions thrown from the
try-with-resources statement are suppressed. So the exception thrown by the implicit
call to `box.close()` is suppressed. A suppressed exception forms the cause of the
exception that suppresses it. It can be retrieved by using method `getSuppressed()`
on the exception handler, as follows:

[source,java]
----
catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("catch: " + e);
    for (Throwable th : e.getSuppressed()) {
        System.out.println(th);
    }
}
----

It prints the following:

----
catch: java.lang.Exception
java.lang.Exception
----

IMPORTANT: If an exception is thrown from the `try` block and one or more exceptions are thrown
           from the try-with-resources statement, then those exceptions thrown from the
           try-with-resources statement are suppressed.

=== Exercise 6.16

What's the output of the following code?

[source,java]
----
class Admission implements AutoCloseable {
    String id;
    Admissison(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("close:" + id);
    }
}
class CloseableResource {
    public stativ void main(String... args) {
        try (Admission a1 = new Admission("2765");
             Admission a2 = new Admission("8562");) {}
    }
}
----

. `close:8562`, `close:2765`
. `close:2765`, `close:8562`
. Compilation error
. Runtime exception

The answer is A. The code compiles successfully, and no runtime exceptions are thrown during its
execution, The resources initialized in a try-with-resources statement are closed in the reverse
order.

IMPORTANT: The resources initialized in a try-with-resources statement are closed in the reverse
order.
