/**
 * Use the cat health API to verify that your three-node cluster is up running. The cat APIs return
 * information about your cluster and indices in a format thatâ€™s easier to read than raw JSON.
 *
 * <p>You can interact directly with your cluster by submitting HTTP requests to the Elasticsearch
 * REST API. Most of the examples in this guide enable you to copy the appropriate cURL command and
 * submit the request to your local Elasticsearch instance from the command line. If you have Kibana
 * installed and running, you can also open Kibana and submit requests through the Dev Console.
